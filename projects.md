## List of ideas:
If I find time search for existing solutions or implement something or just
do it

 - Live develop Stream

   Streaming on twitch while developing. Did a test run for screeps,
   explaining while developing is a nice twist. Should continue.

 - Shopping list automation

   I'm using [Todoist] for (shared) lists, ToDo, Shopping ...
    - Automatic shopping list filling, like Milk every 5 days
    - Sorting based on the shop I'm going
    - Automatic rewrite of entries for more explicit descriptions
    - ...

 - Trader app

   I still believe that you can make some positive outcome by having something
   running for long time without caring. Maybe based on bitcoins.

 - Development via chat
