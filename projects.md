## Currently working on:

   - [screeps]
   - [My monitoring]
 - 3d printer
   - Protos V2 3d
   - Currently broken, when adding the second Extruder
   - [Thingiverse]
 - Employed at [exoscale]
 - IoT
   Multiple 433Mhz senders and receivers and some Philipps hue components for
   controlling lights. Local Raspberry PI with [Home Assistant] as control
   interface.
   
## List of ideas:
If I find time search for existing solutions or implement something or just
do it

 - Live develop Stream
   Streaming on twitch while developing. Did a test run for screeps,
   explaining while developing is a nice twist. Should continue.
 - Packing app
   When I need to pack my bag, have a list what I want to take with me.
   Especially since my daughter need some more stuff, I have to take we me.
 - TickTick API
   I'm using [TickTick] for (shared) lists, ToDo, Shopping ...
   As soon as they open up their API, there is a lot of potential e.g.
    - Automatic shopping list filling, like Milk every 5 days
    - Sorting based on the shop I'm going
    - Automatic rewrite of entries for more explicit descriptions
    - ...
 - Trader app
   I still believe that you can make some positive outcome by having something
   running for long time without caring. Maybe based on bitcoins.
 - Development via chat
