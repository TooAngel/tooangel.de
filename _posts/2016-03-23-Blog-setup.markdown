Based upon [server setup] I want to have some kind of homepage or blog.
I think [wordpress] is still the number one choice, but PHP no, not this time.
Some random CMS? Python would be nice. In the end I had a look at [mezzanine]
which looks okayish.
At [exoscale] I'm currently working on runstatus, which generates static status
pages. This led me also to the idea to have something static. [GitHub Pages]
came first to my mind. But again the american, big company topic.

Anyway I think [GitHub] is an awesome company, open sourcing and supporting a
lot of cool tools. So I came to [jekyll] and give it a try.
