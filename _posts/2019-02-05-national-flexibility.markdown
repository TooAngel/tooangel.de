Instead of being fixed to arbitrary country borders, introduce some flexibility
to motivate countries to take of their citizens.

The idea is to behind a certain number of square meter land to a person. On
immigration the original country owes the new country some land.

In certain intervals the borders are new negotiated.

To even out the current in equality in land to citizen certain factors can be
applied to even this out.

To keep it simple I would suggest to ignore any ad- or disadvantages of certain
area, because there are no hard factor what is good and what not.

Having such system in place would motivate countries to make sure people want
to immigrate or more important that the current ones are happy and don't want
to move somewhere else.
