Requirements:

 - Hosted in Germany or at least Europe
 - Hosted by a small provider

I couldn't find a noteworthy blog provider in Germany. As hosting provider I
found [accelerated], which looked promising. Ordered a dedicated server, it
took some days until I got access, which was a bit surprising, being used IaaS
like [AWS], [google compute engine], [OpenStack] and [CloudStack]. The web
interface looks old, the newest ubuntu version which I can install is:
`Installation Ubuntu 12.04 LTS - BETA (64-Bit)`. Not so important,
the idea is to explore and improve reasonable security, so I don't want
to have a 'random' pre installed operation system.
