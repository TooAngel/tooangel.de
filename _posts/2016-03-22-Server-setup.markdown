Requirements: 

 - Hosted in germany or at least europe
 - Hosted by a small provider
 
I cloudn't find a noteworthy blog provider in germany. As hoster I found
[accelerated], which looked promising. Ordered a dedicated server, it took
some days until I got access, which was a bit surprising, being used IaaS like
[aws], [google compute engine], [openstack] and [cloudstack]. The web
interface looks old, the newest ubuntu version which I can install is:
`Installation Ubuntu 12.04 LTS - BETA (64-Bit)`. Not so important,
the idea is to explore and improve reasonable security, so I don't want
to have a 'random' pre installed operation system.
