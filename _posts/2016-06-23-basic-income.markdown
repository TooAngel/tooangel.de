I heard the idea ~10 years ago, where it was discussed in a [attac]
presentation. Don't know how I ended up there. Since then I'm thinking
and discussing with different people the topic.

The voting in Switzerland a couple of weeks ago was an interesting
event. I didn't read to much about it and I had hoped for more votes
on the supporter side.

In the following I have mostly Germany in mind, because I know it best.
I guess you can abstract specifics to your country, if not I'm happy
about a message, if my ideas can't fit to your country.

In my opinion one of the most important questions: __Is the society capable
of doing the necessary tasks to survive__

Let's start at the beginning:

## My definition:
__Everybody within a group gets money to live.__

 - __Everybody__: No more rules: too old, too young, too tall, too small,
   religious, sexual orientation, colored ... it doesn't matter
 - __within a group__: I'm not yet sure about the dimensions to start with is
   best. Some friends, a village, a town, county, country, continent, world.
   I think it is best to have a country in mind.
 - __gets money to live__: It should be regular, like every month. It should
   be money, not coupons for something, just money, so that everybody can
   decide what to spend on. It should be enough to live, but also not much more.
   I have usually 1000 Euro in mind.

## Who pays

### Reducing jobs

In German we have a couple of different system which hand out money to people
with special needs:

 - Parental and child
 - Pension
 - Unemployment
 - ....

In all these systems many people are working to check if they have to hand out
the money and the exact amount.

### Adapting the pay

## Why

Saving jobs => Reducing jobs
Fear of unemployment
There will not be enought jobs
