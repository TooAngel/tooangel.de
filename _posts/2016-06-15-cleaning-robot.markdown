When I was working at the University of Bonn (~2008), we built a robot platform
with 4 Roombas, which was very flexible in changing the direction, because
each of the Roomba could rotate independently. You can see a small version
on the [nimbro page], the last one 'Roomba QuadDrive' (2016-06-15).

So I got my contact to cleaning robots pretty early, while it took some time
until I saw the first one actually cleaning the floor. Somehow I never had
a good reason to buy one of those.

Due to my current circumstances, especially having a infant, which likes to
distribute small stuff on the floor, the cleaning robot idea came up again.
I'm anyway interested in autonomous systems, robots, and all these kind of
stuff. I think it is often a good approach to start with a low invest, get
something and see what are the important features for you. In this case,
buy a cheap one. Also I would like it to have a base station, to be able
to autorecharge.

The cheapest one I could find was the Haier SWR-T325, arrived today.
After buying I tried to find a bit more about tuning / hacking this
model. I couldn't find anything. Also searching for technical details,
except the usual product details didn't lead to a noteworthy result.
Even on the [haier] page I couldn't find this device - Not so convincing.

After the first hours I got a good impression for that price.
180 degree bumpers to the front, two brushes and the possibility to attach
a wet cleaner (what's the name for it in english?). A remote control, makes
sense, catching the robot and hitting the right button, could get annoying.

4 programs: Just clean, especially dirty places, edges and scheduled.
IMHO I need two:

 - Now: Clean everything good
 - Scheduled / Daily: Like now, just automatic

Anyway, will see how it works out.

The first run was ~20 minutes, movement looks partly random. Ended up twice
in the bath room and closed the door (as you should when you are in the
bathroom). Would be nice it it could open it afterwards again.
Cleaning the dirt surprised me. You can open the cover easily and take out
a plastic box. After ~20 minutes the box was well feed with dirt, didn't
expect that.

I didn't check too much for others, but I'm a bit disappointet, that I don't
have any connectors. Bluetooth, Wifi or any connection would be nice.
Get some kind of notification when the roboter starts cleaning, or trigger
the cleaning via API, monitor the cleaning duration, ... there are so many
nice things you can build around.

Will update when I gathered more experience.
